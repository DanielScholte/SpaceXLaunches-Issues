				  <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p> <p> I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an
                    error in the app I collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone
                    called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,

                  </p> <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p> <p>This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries
                    that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                  </p> <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p> <p> I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p> <ul><li>To facilitate our Service;</li> <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li> <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li> <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li></ul> <p> I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your
                    Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they
                    are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                  </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p> I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving
                    to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over
                    the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee
                    its absolute security.
                  </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed
                    to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly
                    advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over

                  </p> <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p> <p>These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
                    personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child
                    under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from
                    our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal
                    information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
                  </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review
